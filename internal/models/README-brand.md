# Brand Management

This module provides CRUD operations for ammunition brands in the Virtual Armory system.

## Overview

Brands represent ammunition manufacturers or brand names that users can associate with their ammunition. This helps users keep track of different ammunition sources and preferences.

## Model Structure

The `Brand` model has the following fields:

- `ID` (uint): The unique identifier for the brand
- `Name` (string): The full name of the brand (e.g., "Federal Premium")
- `Nickname` (string): An optional abbreviation or common name (e.g., "Fed")
- `Popularity` (int): A numeric value indicating popularity/importance (higher values appear first in dropdowns)
- `CreatedAt` (time.Time): When the record was created
- `UpdatedAt` (time.Time): When the record was last updated
- `DeletedAt` (time.Time): For soft deletion (if implemented)

## Database Methods

The following methods are available for working with brands:

- `FindAllBrands()`: Retrieves all brands from the database
- `FindBrandByID(id uint)`: Retrieves a specific brand by ID
- `CreateBrand(brand *Brand)`: Creates a new brand
- `UpdateBrand(brand *Brand)`: Updates an existing brand
- `DeleteBrand(id uint)`: Deletes a brand by ID

## Admin Features

The admin interface provides a complete CRUD system for brands:

- **List View**: View all brands with sorting and filtering
- **Detail View**: View details for a specific brand
- **Create**: Add new brands to the system
- **Edit**: Modify existing brands
- **Delete**: Remove brands from the system

## Best Practices

When working with brands:

1. Brand names should be unique to avoid confusion
2. Set appropriate popularity values to ensure the most common brands appear first in dropdown menus
3. Use the nickname field for common abbreviations or alternative names that users might recognize

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the brand system:

- Add support for brand logos or images
- Implement brand-specific metadata (country of origin, specialties, etc.)
- Provide brand statistics (usage metrics across the platform)
- Add integration with external ammunition databases for standardized information
