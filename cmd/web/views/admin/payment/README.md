# Admin Payment History Feature

## Overview
The Admin Payment History feature allows administrators to view all payments made by users in the system. This helps administrators track revenue, monitor subscription payments, and identify any payment issues or cancellations.

## Features
- View all payments in a sortable table format
- See payment details including:
  - Date and time of payment
  - User ID
  - Payment description
  - Payment type (subscription, one-time, etc.)
  - Amount with currency
  - Payment status (succeeded, failed, pending, refunded, canceled)
  - Stripe payment ID for reference

## Implementation Details

### Database
- Uses the existing `Payment` model
- Added a new `GetAllPayments()` method to the database service

### Controller
- `AdminPaymentController` handles the payments history page
- The controller retrieves all payments from the database and passes them to the view

### View
- `payments_history.templ` displays all payments in a tabular format
- Payment status is color-coded for easy identification:
  - Green: Succeeded
  - Yellow: Pending
  - Red: Failed
  - Blue: Refunded
  - Gray: Canceled or other statuses

### Routes
- Route: `/admin/payments-history`
- The route is protected with admin authentication

### Admin Sidebar
- The payment history link is placed under the "User Management" section
- Replaces the previous "Subscriptions" placeholder

## Technical Notes
- Payments are sorted by creation date (newest first)
- The page is accessible only to users with administrator permissions
- Uses the standard admin layout with the admin sidebar

## Future Enhancements
- Add filtering by date, user, payment type, or status
- Add search functionality
- Add export to CSV capability
- Add detailed payment analytics and reports
- Link user IDs to user detail pages
